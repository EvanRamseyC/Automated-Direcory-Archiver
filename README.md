Automated Directory Archiver

All projects that follow this structure will work for the script:
       -A year that you are working with
       -One directory that contains all the subdirectories you want to archive for that given year
       -One directory that contains all the mod (xml) files for a year you want to MOVE to its corresponding subdirectory
        you will archive 
       -One directory where you want your rootdir subdirectories to go after sucessfully archived 
       -One directory where you want your compressed archives to go 
       -one manifest file that you want COPIED into each rootdir subdirectory before archiving 
       -A pattern that you want each archived file to be named by. This script assumes that the archived file will
        be the same name as the mod file inside of it.


Under a given year, the program will perform these actions:
1. Locate the subsequent matching xml(mod file) file and move it to the newspaper directory.
2. Copy the manifiest.ini file from a specific directory to the newspaper directory.
3. Archive each newspaper directory after validating that all the files are there.
4. Puts the archive in a directory of choice
5. Move directories that are already zippped to the folder of the users choice.

You need 7zip to run this script. The script assumes that 7z.exe is in your program files folder (the default one). I also used pycharmer in order to run the scrit

Inputting Data:
The script uses a textfile where you fill in all required information. 
The script uses '=' as a delimiter in the input file. The user should only add their inputs after the = sign.
the 'path' is the string of text at the top of your file explorer. Example: C:\Users\evanr\OneDrive\Documents\FSU\Zip_Project. This should be copy and pasted instead of typed out.

When the script runs, you must provide the path to reach your inputfile which you have downloaded. When you run your script, it will also make an errorlog file in the same folder your inputfile is in to log any errors that occur.

Values for input file:
The user will put each value after the '='. You can download the template in github called inputfile.txt
Year = "Year you are working with"
ex. 1893

1ReadyToProcess = the path that has all the subdirectories you want to archive in this instance. This path should include the words "1ReadyToProcess" and the year you are working on
Ex. G:\Digitization\CurrentProjects\Il_Secolo\1ReadyToProcess\1893

2MODS should be the copied path that contains the folder that has your xml files. The path should include the keywords "2MODS" and the year you are working in.
Ex. G:\Digitization\CurrentProjects\Il_Secolo\2MODS\1893

3Processed should be the copied path that is the directory you want your finished 1ReadyToProcess folders to move into. This path should include the keyword "3Processed"
Ex. G:\Digitization\CurrentProjects\Il_Secolo\3Processed

4ReadytoLoad is where your archives will appear once finished. This path should include the word "4ReadytoLoad
G:\Digitization\CurrentProjects\Il_Secolo\4ReadytoLoad

ziproot and zip confirmation is the root for what you want the name of the archive to be. The script assumes that the archive needs to be the same as the
2MODS file, so it will include an underscore and the date for each mode to the archive when it is created. The user manually puts in the base name, which is everything before the underscore that has the date after it. 

Your ziproot is also how the script finds the xml file so the script will not work if the base name of the zip file if different than your 2MODS file.
Example. If the zip is supposed to be FSU_IlSecolo_08121893, your ziproot and zip confirmation will be "FSU_IlSecolo. The base name is FSU_IlSecolo because it is before the specific date after the underscore and it is a consistent pattern.


Errors that occur will be placed in an Error text file. The Error file will be in the same directory that your input file is in, and it will be labeled with the year
the user is working on.


Known Issues:
Will the drive have trouble keeping up with the changes?
Because archiving these files takes time, the drive is typically able to keep up. You may have difficulty navigating that directory as it will be slower, but you can load an entire year without issue.

The script cannot archive folders if the path to reach it includes any spaces. Example: "C:\Users\evanr\OneDrive\Documents\FSU\Zip_Project" is a valid path.
"C:\Users\evanr\OneDrive\Documents\FSU\Zip Project" is not. This means you must make sure that your 1ReadyToProcess directory's path has no spaces at all.
If a space exists, you must rename the folder with the space first and remove the space.

You cannot use the script if you want to name the archive differently than the xml file should be inside it. The base name of the archive, everything before its specific date at the end of its name, must be the same as the base name of your xml file(everything before its specific date at the end of its name.) Otherwise it will not find any xml files to move, and it will not archive directories that do not have an xml file.


7zip will sometimes crash which causes the script to end. It does not cause any damage however, so you can just rerun the script and it will pick up where it left off.
